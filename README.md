## Mission Statement

My goal is to create a free and open-source 3D block game to
serve as a platform for creativity, education and collaboration.
Every aspect of the project should be visible to the public. My
hope is that by being a part of this community, anyone can learn
technical skills and how to work in a collaborative environment.
